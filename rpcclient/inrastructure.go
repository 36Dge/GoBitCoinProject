//client represents a bitclient Rpc client which allows easy access to the
//various rpc methods available on a bitcoin rpc server .each of the wrapper
//fucntions handle the details of converting the passed and return types to and
//from the underlying json types which are required for the json-rpc invocations.

// The client provides each RPC in both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous
// (non-blocking) forms.  The asynchronous forms are based on the concept of
// futures where they return an instance of a type that promises to deliver the
// result of the invocation at some future time.  Invoking the Receive method on
// the returned future will block until the result is available if it's not
// already.
